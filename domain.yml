  - text: The NYC Kids RISE Save for College Program is a scholarship and savings program designed to make college and career training more accessible and achievable for all NYC public school students— regardless of their family’s income or immigration status—starting with School District 30 in Queens.
  utter_faq/2:
  - text: 'Once your child is enrolled in the program, NYC Kids RISE will create an NYC Scholarship Account and automatically deposit $100 for your child’s educational future. As your child continues their education, NYC Kids RISE will offer opportunities for your family to earn more money toward this account. Other members of the community, including community organizations and businesses, can also add to the scholarship accounts to help your child reach their college and career goals. The scholarship funds are invested in New York’s 529 College Savings Program Direct Plan, a type of account specifically designed to help families save for higher education. Your child’s NYC Scholarship Account can gain or lose money over time, depending on financial markets and the performance of the investment. That means the amount available in a child’s NYC Scholarship Account when that child attends college may be more or less than the amounts originally deposited by NYC Kids RISE into the account. You will receive a Welcome Kit from NYC Kids RISE when your child’s NYC Scholarship Account is opened. For you to access your child’s NYC Scholarship Account and view the funds for the first time and throughout your child’s educational journey:'
  utter_faq/3:
  - text: After your child receives their NYC Scholarship Account, you will receive more information on how to create a college savings plan that is right for you and your family. To build on the money invested in your child’s NYC Scholarship Account, you will have an opportunity to open your own college savings account. You own your college savings account. You, your relatives, and your friends can contribute directly to this account. Depending on which option you choose, your family can track your savings balance next to your child’s NYC Scholarship Account through the online NYC Kids RISE Savings Tracker. Throughout the school year, you will have the opportunity to participate in Save for College Program workshops that can help you consider your options. Back to Top
  utter_faq/4:
  - text: It can be tough to save for college. For many families, sending their children to college may seem out of reach. NYC Kids RISE, in partnership with the City of New York and the NYC Department of Education, started the Save for College Program to empower families to begin saving and planning for college and career training from their child’s very first days of school. Research shows that children with a college savings account of between $1 and $500 are three times more likely to enroll in college and more than four times more likely to graduate. Research also shows that children who attend college earn a significantly higher salary over their lifetimes and are less likely to be unemployed.
  utter_faq/5:
  - text: Every kindergarten, first-grade, second-grade, and third-grade family in District 30 can participate in the Save for College Program regardless of the child’s or their family’s immigration status. Families do not need to provide a Social Security Number (SSN) or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) for the child to be enrolled in the program and receive an NYC Scholarship Account. When considering whether to open your own college savings account, please note that this is separate from the child’s NYC Scholarship Account. Both types of college savings accounts currently available through the program require an SSN or ITIN to open. In addition, if you choose to open your own college savings account in the NY 529 Direct Plan, you must meet the IRS definition of U.S. citizen or resident alien with a verified U.S. address. You do not have to open your own account to receive and keep the free NYC Scholarship Account. If you do not have this information, remember that a family member or trusted friend can open an account for your child. Contact NYC Kids RISE or participate in an event to learn more. Our multilingual staff are here to help you find the information you need to make a plan that makes sense for you and your family.
  utter_faq/6:
  - text: Money in the NYC Scholarship Account is invested in the NY 529 Direct Plan and can be used only for higher education. This includes two-year and four-year colleges and other career training programs The scholarship funds can be used for tuition, fees, equipment, some room-and-board expenses, and even things like textbooks, which are often not covered by other scholarships. The funds can be used at academic and vocational programs in New York and across the country, as well as at some schools in other countries. Visit nysaves.org for a full list of qualifying higher education expenses. Money in the NYC Scholarship Account cannot be used for any K-12 expenses, including those that qualify under federal law.
  utter_faq/7:
  - text: A student can only access the money in their NYC Scholarship Account if the student attends a qualifying institution, which includes most two- and four-year colleges, as well as specialized training and certification programs. If the student does not claim these funds within 20 years after they complete kindergarten, then those funds will go back to NYC Kids RISE to support future Save for College Program students. Families can keep any money they deposit into their own college savings account, regardless of whether their student attends a qualifying institution. Depending on the type of college savings account option the family chooses, they may have to pay a tax or penalty to use the money for other expenses besides qualified educational expenses.

  utter_faq/17:
  - text: Every family’s situation is different. College savings are one important piece of a family’s overall financial health. Deciding how much to save for college or career training depends on your individual financial circumstances, including your income, assets, debt, regular expenses, public benefits, and credit. NYC Kids RISE encourages every family to start contributing at whatever amount makes sense for them. Getting started while your child is young can make a big difference, regardless of the amount. For free, one-on-one support with fitting savings into your overall financial picture, consider visiting one of the NYC Financial Empowerment Centers located throughout the city. At the Financial Empowerment Centers, you can meet one-on-one with a professional financial counselor who can help you tackle debt, improve your credit, create a budget, open a bank account, save and plan for your future, and more.

  utter_faq/34:
  - text: Children who have a college savings account and a plan for higher education are more likely to attend and graduate from college. Research shows that children with a college savings account of just $1 to $500 are three times more likely to enroll in college and more than four times more likely to graduate with a degree. The hope is that participating students’ NYC Scholarship Accounts will grow over time through additional rewards and Community Scholarships (subject to potential investment gains or losses), making college more accessible for every child.
  utter_faq/35:
  - text: NYC Kids RISE will provide opportunities for families to earn additional deposits, or rewards, toward their NYC Scholarship Account. The first three rewards are for completing what we call the “3 Building Blocks”. These three steps lay the foundation for our long-term partnership to save together for your child’s future:NYC Kids RISE will deposit $25 into your child’s scholarship account for each of these Building Blocks, if you complete them by the end of the semester after your child is enrolled in the Save for College Program. After that deadline, the reward amount decreases. NYC Kids RISE will also offer other reward opportunities for your child’s account through third grade. Visit nyckidsrise.org or call 833-543-7473 for the latest reward deadlines and announcements.
  utter_faq/36:
  - text: No, families cannot make deposits into individual NYC Scholarship Accounts. NYC Kids RISE encourages families to consider opening their own college savings account and starting to make contributions to that account. Community members, including organizations and businesses, can contribute to the scholarship accounts of a group of students by donating to NYC Kids RISE.
  utter_faq/37:
  - text: The NYC Scholarship Account is invested in the NY 529 Direct Plan. Funds in the NY 529 Direct Plan are invested in financial markets with compound earnings, so the scholarship account can grow over time. For example, if your child had $300 in their scholarship account (the $100 initial contribution plus $200 in potential rewards), their account would be estimated to grow to approximately $500 by the time the student graduated high school. This is based on a hypothetical return rate of approximately 4.5% per year, over 13 years. However, because money in the scholarship account is invested, the scholarship account could also lose money at times, depending on the performance of the investment. That means that the amount available for your child from the NYC Scholarship Account when your child attends college may be more or less than the amounts originally deposited by NYC Kids RISE into the account.
  utter_faq/38:
  - text: A 529 account is a type of account specifically designed to help families save for college. Money in a 529 account can grow over time and comes with tax benefits, including tax-free earnings and potential state income tax deductions. However, money in a 529 account is not guaranteed to grow and can also lose value. The NY 529 Direct Plan is a 529 college savings plan administered by the Office of the Comptroller of the State of New York and the New York Higher Education Services Corporation. Most other states also offer their own versions of 529 accounts that can help you achieve your savings goals. However, these other 529 accounts cannot be connected to your child’s scholarship account.
  utter_faq/39:
  - text: NYC Kids RISE owns and manages the NYC Scholarship Accounts and determines how the funds are invested. NYC Kids RISE has chosen to invest the scholarship accounts in the NY 529 Direct Plan. Within that plan, NYC Kids RISE has chosen to invest the scholarship funds in the “Moderate Age-Based Option.” For more information about the NY 529 Direct Plan and its investment options, visit nysaves.org or call 877-NYSAVES.
  utter_faq/40:
  - text: Having an NYC Scholarship Account should not prohibit your child from receiving other scholarships in the future, though that may depend on the terms of those other scholarships. Please review the terms of those scholarships and contact NYC Kids RISE at 833-543- 7473 with questions.
  utter_faq/41:
  - text: Money contributed by NYC Kids RISE and by community supporters into the NYC Scholarship Accounts can be used for more than just tuition. If a student qualifies for free tuition at a CUNY or SUNY college through the Excelsior Scholarship, they can use funds from their NYC Scholarship Account toward the many other costs of college. This includes books, supplies, computers, and some room-and-board fees. Also, the NYC Scholarship Account can be used at most two- and four-year colleges and career training programs around the country, as well as at some in other countries.
  utter_faq/42:
  - text: NYC Kids RISE will provide students and their parents/guardians with information about how to access their NYC Scholarship Accounts when the students are in high school. NYC Kids RISE is committed to making these funds available when your participating child attends college, regardless of the program’s future expansion.
  utter_faq/43:
  - text: The deadline for using the money in your child’s NYC Scholarship Account is 20 years after the school year in which your student began kindergarten. For example, students who began kindergarten in September 2017 will be able to apply for and use their scholarship funds for qualified college or career training expenses until June 30, 2038. If there are any unclaimed funds left after that deadline, those funds will go back to NYC Kids RISE to support the Save for College Program in future years.
  utter_faq/44:
  - text: No, the NYC Scholarship Account is set aside specifically for your child’s education after high school. Money in the scholarship account cannot be transferred to another child.
  utter_faq/45:
  - text: Because the NYC Scholarship Accounts are owned and managed by NYC Kids RISE, having a scholarship account does not impact a student’s or family’s application for public benefits.

  - text: 'Bank accounts and 529 accounts are both options for saving money for college. However, 529 accounts are invested in financial markets, which come with both greater potential risks and greater potential rewards. A savings account at a bank like Amalgamated Bank, on the other hand, is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000.1 Contributing to a 529 account, including the NY 529 Direct Plan, also comes with certain tax benefits that do not come with most bank accounts. 529 accounts are specifically designed for families saving for a child’s education after high school. If a withdrawal from the 529 account is used for anything other than qualified educational expenses, the earnings portion of the withdrawal may be taxed as ordinary income and families may incur a 10 percent tax penalty on the earnings. The withdrawal may also be subject to state and local taxes.1: The standard deposit insurance coverage limit is $250,000 per depositor, per FDIC-insured bank, per ownership category.
